# DHT
A fully working implementation of Distributed Hash Table in Java. Deployed and Tested on AWS.

This is a project focused on creating a peer-to-peer structured overlay network for cloud deployment. This robust DHT was implemented using Java and gRPC and explores innovative designs for clint notifications.

#Features
- Peer-to-Peer Overlay Network: Developed a structured overlay network optimized for cloud environments.
- Java and gRPC Implementation: Leveraged Java and gRPC for a scalable and efficient DHT.
- Push-Based Design Experimentation: Implemented and tested a push-based notification system for new key bindings, offering an alternative to the traditional pull-based protocol.
- AWS EC2 Deployment: Deployed both push-based and pull-based versions of the DHT network on multiple AWS EC2 instances for comprehensive testing and performance analysis.

#Technologies Used
- Java
- gRPC
- AWS EC2
